Inspire Questions, Creative Rethinking and Possibilities: Contemplating Life Without Internet and Electricity â€“ A Journey Through Traditional and Emerging Communication Alternative

What if there were no internet access?

Well, the obvious is that you wouldn't be able to read this page unless you cloned the repo at some point. I still do on this Nov 17th, so I will keep writing down my thoughts on this topic. 

Could you continue living your life as you do today? 

How would you communicate, work and code ? 
- First project I ever worked on was a Crytsal Radio. It needed no energy, jsut copper wires for the antenna and the coil, a variable capacitor, a galena crystal, a diode and a piezo electric crystal Earphone. Most of these pieces were readily availalble, thanks to my class mate whose father was electrician and one of my favorite hobby was collecting stones. Large quantities of copper wires were also easily accessible, each years the Bay of Biscay storms would inflict damages on the electrical  and communucation infrastructure, that included those on the path that lead to my school each days. I trasnform a part of the attic in our house to an electonic lab, away from my siblings and other distractions. That firs project taught me a lot about radio signals and started what is still today an everlasting passion, radio signals and making antyhing that can emit or catch them.
- The second project was not yet realted to AM but still to understand signals. It was also driven by the large amount of copper wires I amassed on my way back from school. A metal detector. I was eyeing one in the "Tandy" electronic store butcouldn't afford it. So I decided to make my own. Unfortunaltely I don't have pictures, but that's ok, it wouldn't win a beauty contest anyway :). I learned a lot with that project and especially about interferences caused by the other metal parts I used, which led me to use wood and glue for the coil part. Not the best looking kit :) . I eventually got some money scanning the nearby beach which finally got me the proper metal detector and some sweets.
- Third, as you guessed, I made my first transmitter.
